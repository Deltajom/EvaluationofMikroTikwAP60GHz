# EvaluationofMikroTikwAP60GHz
This repo is set up as a basic reference for the creation of a bridged connection between a MikroTik wAP 60G and a MikroTik wAP 60Gx3. There is also an included unity application for the HoloLens 2 that implements a VERY basic HTTP get from a remote server to allow for bandwidth testing.
